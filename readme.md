How to Play
--

Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left side of the screen, and competes against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. Points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.

**Controls**

Player 1 can navigate the paddle up & down using the W & S keys. On the other hand, player 2 can do the same using the UP & DOWN arrow keys.
